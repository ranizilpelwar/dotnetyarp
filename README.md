This repo contains three .NET apps that experiment with configuring a reverse proxy using
YARP, "Yet Another Reverse Proxy", an open-source package from Microsoft.
The api is a .NET API. The UI is a .NET Razor app. 
All are using .NET 8 Preview. 
With .NET 6, the Startup.cs file is no longer supported, so all the configuration
goes into the Program.cs file.
